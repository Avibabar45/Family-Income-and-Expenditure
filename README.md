 ### KMeans Clustering 


## Description 
Family Income and Expenditure this is our dataset , 
on this dataset we are using KMeans clustering model is a Machine Learning model.
 
 K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data into K distinct clusters based on similarity. It’s fast, intuitive, and widely used for pattern discovery and segmentation.



## 🔍 What Is K-Means Clustering?
K-Means is a centroid-based algorithm that partitions data into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). It’s ideal for:

Customer segmentation

Image compression

Anomaly detection



## ⚙️ How K-Means Works (Step-by-Step)
Choose K: Decide the number of clusters.

1. Initialize Centroids: Randomly select K data points as initial centroids.

2. Assign Points: Each point is assigned to the nearest centroid.

3. Update Centroids: Recalculate centroids as the mean of assigned points.

4. Repeat: Steps 3–4 until centroids stabilize (convergence).
## 📈 Choosing the Right K (Elbow Method)
Plot the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) for different K values. The "elbow" point where WCSS starts to flatten suggests the optimal K.
